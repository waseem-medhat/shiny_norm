### Dataset variables

After you have selected a dataset, the variable names will fetched and filtered
so that only the numeric variables are shown in the choices.

**Warning**: some datasets have categorical variables stored in a numeric form.
These cannot be filtered out by the app, but they should be easily spotted when
the histogram shows that the variable takes distinct finite values (which is the
textbook definition of a cateogrical variable).
