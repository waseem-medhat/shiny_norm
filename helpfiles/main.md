A lot of parametric tests assume a normal distribution of the statistic of
interest. One way to test that assumption is by examining how similar or
(dissimilar) your sample is to the a normal distribution, and this is exactly
the purpose of this app: to provide some tools, graphical and statistical, to
test a variable's distribution against the normal.
