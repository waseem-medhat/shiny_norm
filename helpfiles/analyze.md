### Graphical and statistical analysis of normality

* * *

- The **histogram** shows the frequency distribution for the variable. There are
  two overlaid curves: a regular line representing the variable (i.e. kernel
  density estimate) and a dashed line of a normal distribution.
  
- The normal **Q-Q plot** is another graphical tool to test normality. The
  closer the points are to the diagonal line, the more similar the distribution
  is to the normal

- **Goodness-of-fit tests** give p-values based on comparisons between the
  distribution of the variable to the normal. Remember that the null hypothesis
  of these tests is that the sample _comes from a normal distribution_, which
  means you should expect that nearly normal distributions will get large 
  p-values (above the significance level).

**Note**: Remember that you don't want to prove that your variable _is_ normal
-- technically, this is never true. The goal is determining if tests/models that
assume a normal distribution are a good fit for the variable.
