### Built-in datasets

These are datasets that are built into
[the R software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language\)).
You can try different variables in those sets to experiment with the behavior of
graphical and statistical tests.

**Warning**: some of these datasets have categorical variables stored in a
numeric form. The graphs should easily show how they fall into distinct finite
values (which is the textbook definition of a cateogrical variable).
